%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20190108 TO 20200430

F0AMv4

Throughout: changed "CAUTION" statements to warnings and tried to standardized warning/error messages

F0AM_ModelCore:

    FAMILY CONSTRAINTS
        Added ability to conserve total concentration of a family of species (e.g. NOx).
        Families are indicated within the InitConc input as a nested cell array (see user manual).
        Code was added to multiple sections in F0AM_ModelCore to handle the inputs.
        Other modifications to subroutines (IntegrateStep, Jac_eval, dydt_eval) as described below.
        Also added a new function, Mass_eval.m, for ODE treatment.
        This code still doesn't work quite right, needs TLC.

    CONVERGENCE CRITERIA
        Added options for solar cycle only that force it to run until "true" steady-state is reached.
        Major modifications to F0AM_ModelCore and IntegrateStep. See manual for details.

    ASSIGN DEFAULTS AND CHECK INPUTS Section:
     - Added input check for jcorr when it is input as a string or cell array.
     - Replace Met.tgauss with default value (inf) if both tgauss and kdil are specified in Met.
     - Added warning that input SZA is overwritten in solar cycle mode.

    INTEGRATION section
     - renamed i to "istep" for better readability.

    MODEL OPTIONS section
     - Removed ModelOptions.Repeat functionality. Use the new "InputReplicate" function instead (see below).
     - Tweaked ModelOptions.Verbose levels. See user manual for definitions.

InitializeChemistry:
 - Modified error message for checking presence of jcorr variables in Jnames

IntegrateStep:
 - Added mass matrix for ODE to accomodate family conservation code.

Jac_eval:
 - Added comments and spaced out some code for clarity.
 - Added a few lines to accomodate family conservation constraints.

dydt_eval:
 - Added a few lines for family conservation.

Hybrid J-values:
 - Changed vertical profiles of T and P used to calculate J-values.
   T: Was using a lapse rate of 9.8 K/km, switched to U.S. standard atmosphere value of 6.5 K/km below 11 km, 0 K/km above.
   P: Now uses correct US standard atmosphere formulae (see wikipedia and USatmos.m).
 - Added calc_HybridJtables.m and TUV_ActFlux_tables.mat to \Chem\Photolysis\ so that users can generate their own HybridJtables.mat if needed.
   Also added procedure in F0AM_UserManual.

Sherwen 2016 Mechanism:
    New mechanism for GEOSChem halogen scheme as implemented by Romer et al. (2018) for MCMv331.
    Mechanism files located in \Chem\MCMv331\SubMechanisms\Sherwen2016.
    This mechanism is not complete and has some tunable parameters buried in it, so it should be used with caution.
    To accomodate this, also added 14 new J-values to J_BottomUp.m and hybrid tables.
    Also also, added a few bits to InitializeChemistry, dydt_eval, Jac_eval, and F0AM_ModelCore
    to handle the special "limiting reagent" aerosol reactions.

NOAA Biomass burning mechanism:
    New mechanism for oxidation of a handful of biomass-burning relevant VOC.
    This not really a sub-mechanism, but rather an extended version of the full MCM.
    It is not possible to easily separate these b/c of shared reaction products.

SAPRC07B:
    New mechanism and text reader (MEC2F0AM.m). Thanks to Hongyu Chen and Jen Kaiser at GAtech.

GEOSCHEMv12.07:
    New GEOSCHEM mechanism and text reader (EQN2F0AM.m). Thanks to Xiangyu Liu and Jen Kaiser at GAtech.
    Note, previous GEOSCHEM_AllRxns.m renamed to GEOSCHEMv902_AllRxns.m.

New Functions:

    F0AM_benchmark: setup script to evaluate performance when monkeying with model guts.
        Still needs work for standardization.

    Mass_eval: function to generate "mass matrix" used with ODE solver for family conservation.

    USatmos: new function in \Tools\ to calculate T and P altitude profiles for standard US Atmosphere.
    
    calc_HybridJtables: function to regenerate HybridJtables.mat if needed.

    InputReplicate: function to replicate Met and InitConc inputs before calling model.
                    Replaces ModelOptions.Repeat functionality.
                    Use this if, e.g., you want to do a "spin-up."

    InputInterp: function to interpolate Met and InitConc inputs to a finer time resolution.

    PlotRatesGroup: function to plot rates for a chemical family, e.g. HOx or NOx.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20160901 TO 20180320

F0AMv3.2

F0AM_ModelCore: 
    NEW ModelOption.GoParallel: allows parallelizd execution of independent model steps on multiple processors/cores.
        See documentation for more info. Example Setups "Chamber" and "FlightSS" can demonstrate use of this option.
        Required substantial revisions to the ODE solver section.
    
    NEW Gaussian dispersion option: alternative to simple 1st-order dilution; may be more appropriate for Lagrangian plume modeling in some cases.
        Requires new Met input "tgauss." See readme Sect. 6.2 and ExampleSetup_LagrangianPlume for more info.

    Assign Defaults and Check Inputs Section:
        Added checks for incompatible model options
        Moved Met initialization cell array to a sub-function, IntializeMet.m
        Added Met inputs: BLH (boundary layer height), PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density), LAI (leaf area index) for emis/dep
        Added numerous met inputs for particles
        Removed default value for RH. Now water (either H2O or RH) is a required input.
        Removed Met initialization "force vertical arrays", as this is done in the "Check4NanNeg" function farther down.

    SolarCycle: removed the initial step at initial conditions, so now output will have 24 points instead of 25.

    Saving: Changed from saving all variables in the function workspace to a defined list

    Throughout: Removed "clear" commands

Chemistry
    CB6r2 mechanism: scaling for ISPD photolysis changed from 0.0036 to 0.0036/0.0065 (bug)

    CB05_AllRxns.m: Reaction 147, CX03 fraction increased from 0.05 to 0.075 (typo)

    Aerosol folder:
        Deleted function k_mass_transfer_A (it's just a single equation, now in ExampleAerosolRxn.m)


Removed use of nanmean from InitializeChemistry.m and nanmedian from F0AM_ModelCore.m

New functions/scripts
    InitializeMet.m: contains cell array of valid met fields and their default values.
        Separated this from F0AM_ModelCore to allow users more flexibility without need to modify core. 

    struct2parvar.m, parvar2struct.m: facilitate passing of variables into a parfor loop

    IntegrateStep.m: contains all code for executing ODE integration.

	HO2NO2_hv.m: new MCM reaction script for pernitric acid photolysis.

    HOx_HetChem: new reaction script for example OH/HO2 + aerosol reactions, in Chem/Aerosol folder.
    k_massTransfer: helper function for above script.

    \Chem\Emission and \Chem\Deposition: new folders containing some very crude examples for emission and deposition reactions.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20160517

FOAMv3.1: Bug fixes following public release of F0AMv3

Code Changes:
 - F0AM_ModelCore: Added columnization of O3col and albedo.
                   Default albedo changed from 0.2 to 0.1.
 - J_Hybrid: Added line to force SZA upper limit of 90 degrees
 - J functions for CB05, CB6r2, RACM2, GSCHM: added vectorization of 
   fixed altitude (0.5km), O3column (350DU) and albedo (0.01) for MCM option
 - Check4NanNeg: tweaked "any" statements to operate on multi-dimension matrices
 - Added Lagrangian Plume example.
 - Removed IndexNOy tool. SearchSMILES is far superior.

Chemistry Changes:
 - Cross_Section_Cl2: fixed minor issue in T-parameterization and spreadsheet.
 - CB05_K and CB6r2_K: documentation had an error in termolecular rate constants exponent
    (-2 where it should be 2). Fixed it.
 - RACM-2 reaction file streamlined by combining all like reactions (Thanks to SJR).
 - CB6r2 mechanism updated to reflect most recent CAMx implementation. Notes from MRM:
    "I used CAMx v6.1 when I originally wrote CB6r2, but now there’s a CAMx v6.3. Most of the 
    changes relate to NTR chemistry. In the Yarwood documentation for CB6r2, NTR is split into 
    NTR1 and NTR2, but this wasn’t incorporated into the CAMx mechanism until after the release 
    of v6.1, which just uses NTR. Otherwise, the ISPD+OH reaction (R158) was modified to form 
    new products with new product fractions. And HPALD photolysis was changed to remove HO2 as a 
    product. These two changes are NOT consistent with the Yarwood docs, but I’ve included them 
    to stay consistent with CAMx."

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20150601

Began work on F0AMv3. Major changes from UWCM v2.2 listed below.
There are a lot of changes, and this document lists most but probably not all.
See individual scripts and readme for more details.

Inputs
    Met
        Now includes optional input "LightFlux" to specify a light spectrum (actinic flux) for calculation of J-values
          (e.g. when simulating a chamber experiment).
        Added "ALT" input (altitude, m) to support hybrid J-value calculation method.

    ChemFiles
        Input has been modified to facilitate using differnt mechanisms. Now, the first two cells
          must contain names of functions for generic rate constants (K) and photolysis frequencies
          (J), respectively. For more info, see examples and ReadMe.

    SolarCycle
        Removed "UTCoffset" input from SolarCycle timestamp. All input times are assumed to be UTC.
        Replaced "updateTime" input with "nDays". Now the user specifies the total # of days to run the solar cycle,
          and the SZA update time is set to ModelOptions.IntTime.
		
	ModelOptions
        "Verbose" behavior modified. Now gives three tiers of detail depending on input value (0,1,2,3).
        "ChamberLights" input removed. The Met input "LightFlux" now fulfills this role.
        "FixNOx" option added for semi-constraining total NOx.

ModelCore
    Add error check for existence of scripts/functions specified in ChemFiles input.
    Add a line to force ModelOptions.TimeStamp to be a column vector.
    Modify H2O/RH check to throw a warning if both are present (H2O takes priority).
    Add code to accomodate LFlux input in Met.
    Changed variable names:
        "conc_init_now" to "conc_init_step"
        "conc_run" to "conc_out"
        "tmodel_run" to "time_out"
        "tmodel_solar_end" to "time_solar_end"
    Modifications to SolarCycle inputs and behavior:
        Input "SolarParm.updateTime" removed. This is now set to the value of ModelOptions.IntTime.
        Input "SolarParam.nDays" added. This specifies # of days to integrate over.
        Solar cycle now begins and ends at the time of the measurement (before it ended the hour prior).
          So, a 1-day run with IntTime of 3600s will have 25 mini-steps.
 
Chem
    New mechanisms are available. The current list includes MCM, CB05, CB6r2, RACM2 and GEOS-CHEM
	All J, K functions: changed output from name/value pairs to structure,
                        changed input to Met structure.
                        Added "Jmethod" input to all J functions, to allow choice of J calculation
                            (MCM, BOTTOMUP or HYBRID). See ReadMe for more info.

Subs
    breakout
        clean up comments.

    CheckStructure
        Clean up comments and add an "ignorePrefix" optional input to allow passing of certain fields, such as J-value inputs in Met structure.

    Check4NaNNeg
        Add optional input to allow for checking for one or both conditions.
        Now it can be used with solar cycle inputs (which may have negative lat/lon).

    InitializeChemistry
        Deleted line converting P from mbar to Torr.
        Modify to accept new ChemFiles inputs, thereby accomodating different mechanisms (see above).
        Added code to check for duplicate reactions (based on Rnames).
        Major modifications to scaling of photolysis frequencies:
            Functionality to calculate scaling factors for all input J-values
            Propogation of this scaling for Solar Cycle calculations (through variable "jcorr_all")
            Ability to compute generic jcorr (for non-measured J's) using an average of several measured J-values.

    MCMreadnwrite
        Rename to "FAC2F0AM," as its job is to convert FACSIMILE files to F0AM code.
        Remove "fast reaction" code for short-circuiting of reactions with short-lived products.
        Add code to append "+ hv" and "+ RO2" to reactions involving photolysis or RO2.
        Disentangle code for string-building and file-writing.

    Jday2datevec
        New function to facillitate conversion of timestamps from julian day-of-year
          to 6-column date vectors used in SolarCycle.

    GenFilePath
        Changed default save directory from current directory to UWCMv3\Runs subfolder.

    ParsePairs
        New function to parse name-value parameter inputs for functions.
        Mainly used with plotting routines.

Tools
    SplitRun
        Added option to specify a "custom" index for splitting results.
            Useful, for example, for splitting up an aircraft campaign simulation by flight #.
    Lifetime
        New function to calculate total chemical lifetime for a species.

Plots
    ALL plotting function now use name-value pairs for optional inputs.
    See documentation for each plot for available options.

    purtyPlot
        New m-file to change plot style (fonts, line width, etc.).

    PlotConc
        Changed unit input option to name-value pair
        Added scale factor input option

    PlotConcGroup
        Added name-value pair options for unit, scale and plot type.
        Added optional outputs for plotted species (ranked by concentration).

    PlotRates
        Added name-value pair options for unit, scale, plot type and Equilibrium-equation summming.

    PlotRatesROPA
        Removed from service. Use PlotRatesAvg instead.

    PlotRatesAvg
        New function to plot averaged rates for some or all of a model simulation.

    PlotReactivity
        Added name-value pair options, tweaked code to deal with 0 concentration of main reactant.
        
    PlotAllFields
        Removed from service; no practical uses.
                    

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20150409

Modified how EndPointsOnly flag influences output from a SolarCycle run.
Now, setting EndPointsOnly=0 when executing a solar cycle simulation will cause
model to output concentrations and rates for each "mini-step" along the solar cycles, 
as determined by the SolarCycle parameter "updateTime."

Also, the SZA used in the solar cycle run will be stored as a new parameter, SolarParam.SZAcycle.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20140421

 - J. Kaiser noted that the rate constant for OH + CO in the InorganicRxns script reads

    k(:,i) = 1.3e-13.*KMT05;

    which is incorrect. The factor of 1.3e-13 is a mistake from MCMv3.1. It should just be KMT05. 
    I have corrected this in both InorganicRxns_MCM32.m and InorganicRxns_MCM32_Explicit.m

 - Also updated rated constants for HO2 + NO and HO2NO2 + OH


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20131126

 - Moved Equilibrium-filtering code from PlotRates to ExtractRates.
   The latter now accepts an additional input to allow combining of equilibrium reactions
   (e.g. for PAN <--> CH3CO3 + NO2).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20131111

 - Added ability to run model in a "Solar Cycle" mode.
   In this case, the model will execute each step with a time-varying SZA to simulate a day.
   Several additional parameters must be specified in a separate input structure called "SolarParam."
   More info on this will be added to the readme.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20131022

 - Initiated work on v2.2.

 - Default units for pressure are now mbar/hPa.

 - Added submechanisms:
    - InorganicRxns_MCM32_Explicit: explicitly treats O(3P) and O(1D). Also now includes sulfur chemistry.
    - CH4_O1D: methane + O(1D)

 - Added functions:
    - GenFilePath: deals with file path generation (e.g. dated folders)
    - ScaleJ: calculates jcorr by scaling modeled J-values to observations
    - Check4NanNeg: checks input structures for nan and negative values.

 - InitializeChemistry modified to accomodate Met input as structure and Met.P in mbar

 - SplitRun modified for IntTime in ModelOptions

 - UWCM_ModelCore changes:
    - Met, InitConc and BkgdConc converted to structures at beginning of script
    - IntTime now included inside ModelOptions structure and can only be specified as a scalar.
    - Moved jcorr calculation code to ScaleJ.m
    - Moved most of the file generation code to GenFilePath.m
    - Default save path is now current directory
    - Added cell-based CheckStucture for ModelOptions (from CAFE v2.1)
    - Added variable checking for Met
    - Moved input nan/negative checking to a function

 - Updated examples for compatability with other changes

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20131001

 - Bug identified in ISOPO2IsomerizationRxns.m. 1,6 isomerizations should occur for ISOPAO2
   and ISOPCO2, not ISOPBO2 and ISOPDO2. Fixed it.

 - New function, SearchSMILES.m, contained in UWCMtools/SMILES. This function allows indexing of MCM species with specific functional groups (e.g. carbonyls, alcohols, etc.).
   Not rigorously tested, so use with caution.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20121028

UWCM v2.1 released!
