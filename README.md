# F0AM
Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling

INTRODUCTION
F0AM is a MATLAB program for simulating atmospheric chemistry systems. It is designed to be user-friendly and adaptable to a variety of typical applications, including:
 - Analysis of laboratory chamber experiments
 - Interpretation of field observations from stationary and mobile platforms
 - Process and parameter sensitivity studies

 REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

Heterogeneous (Aerosol) chemistry is NOT currently supported, but Joel Thornton and Emma D'Ambro have recently developed a gas-to-particle partitioning extension, the Washington Aerosol Module (WAM).


This is a community tool, and I am always open to suggestions for improvement. Also, regular users are encouraged to enlist in the F0AM users group, a combo email list and Q/A forum.

Happy modeling!
