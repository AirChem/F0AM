# F0AM
Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling

Most recent version: **v3.2

### INTRODUCTION
F0AM is a MATLAB program for simulating atmospheric chemistry systems. It is designed to be user-friendly and adaptable to a variety of typical applications, including:
- Analysis of laboratory chamber experiments
- Interpretation of field observations from stationary and mobile platforms
- Process and parameter sensitivity studies

If F0AM is used to support a scientific publication, please cite the following reference:

In addition, we ask that you send an email to Glenn so that the paper may be added to our list.

### NEW USERS
Welcome! To get started, download the most recent version of the model. In the main directory of F0AM you will find a file called "F0AM_GettingStarted.pdf" that will guide you through the intitial steps. Read the description paer, read the manual, and peruse/run the example setup scripts. Remember that models are like any other research tool - they take time to learn, and they break often.

Regular users are encouraged to enlist in the [F0AM users group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/f0amusers), a combo email list and Q/A forum.

### REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
The "Master" branch contains the most recent public release of F0AM.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

Heterogeneous (aerosol) chemistry is not currently currently supported, but Joel Thornton, Emma D'Ambro and Havala Pye have developed a gas-to-particle partitioning extension, the [Washington Aerosol Module (WAM)](https://www.atmos.washington.edu/~thornton/washington-aerosol-module). This module is a branch from F0AMv3.1 but will be merged with the master branch in the future.

F0AM is a community tool, and we encourage users to share new code/functionality with everyone. You can do so using github's tools; or if you aren't comfortable with that, just send an email to Glenn.
 
Now go forth, and do science.
